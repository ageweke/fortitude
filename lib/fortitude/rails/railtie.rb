        # Why so hard?
        #
        # We're trying to do something that ActiveSupport::Dependencies -- which is what Rails uses for
        # class autoloading -- doesn't really support. We want app/views to be on the autoload path,
        # because there are now Ruby classes living there. (It usually isn't just because all that's there
        # are template source files, not actual Ruby code.) That isn't an issue, though -- adding it
        # is trivial (just do
        # <tt>ActiveSupport::Dependencies.autoload_paths << File.join(Rails.root, 'app/views')</tt>).
        #
        # The real issue is that we want the class <tt>app/views/foo/bar.rb</tt> to define a class called
        # <tt>Views::Foo::Bar</tt>, not just plain <tt>Foo::Bar</tt>. This is what's different from what
        # ActiveSupport::Dependencies normally supports; it expects the filesystem path underneath the
        # root to be exactly identical to the fully-qualified class name.
        #
        # Why are we doing this crazy thing? Because we want you to be able to have a view called
        # <tt>app/views/user/password.rb</tt>, and _not_ have that conflict with a module you just happen to define
        # elsewhere called <tt>User::Password</tt>. If we don't prefix view classes with anything at all, then the
        # potential for conflicts is enormous.
        #
        # As such, we have this code. We'll walk through it step-by-step; note that at the end we *do*
        # add app/views/ to the autoload path, so all this code is doing is just dealing with the fact that
        # the fully-qualified classname (<tt>Views::Foo::Bar</tt>) has one extra component on the front of it
        # (<tt>Views::</tt>) when compared to the subpath (<tt>foo/bar.rb</tt>) underneath what's on the autoload
        # path (<tt>app/views</tt>).
