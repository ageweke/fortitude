        # All of this code is involved in setting up autoload_paths to work with Fortitude.
        # Why so hard?
        #
        # We're trying to do something that ActiveSupport::Dependencies -- which is what Rails uses for
        # class autoloading -- doesn't really support. We want all view paths to be on the autoload path,
        # because there are now Ruby classes living there. (It usually isn't just because all that's there
        # are template source files, not actual Ruby code.) That isn't an issue, though -- adding it
        # is trivial (just do
        # <tt>ActiveSupport::Dependencies.autoload_paths += ::Rails.application.paths['app/views'].expanded</tt>).
        #
        # The real issue is that we want the class (<em>e.g.</em>) <tt>app/views/foo/bar.rb</tt> to define a class
        # called <tt>Views::Foo::Bar</tt>, not just plain <tt>Foo::Bar</tt>. This is what's different from what
        # ActiveSupport::Dependencies normally supports; it expects the filesystem path underneath the
        # root to be exactly identical to the fully-qualified class name.
        #
        # Why are we doing this crazy thing? Because we want you to be able to have a view called
        # <tt>app/views/user/password.rb</tt>, and _not_ have that conflict with a module you just happen to define
        # elsewhere called <tt>User::Password</tt>. If we don't prefix view classes with anything at all, then the
        # potential for conflicts is enormous.
        #
        # As such, we have this code. We'll walk through it step-by-step; note that at the end we *do*
        # add all view paths to the autoload path, so all this code is doing is just dealing with the fact that
        # the fully-qualified classname (<tt>Views::Foo::Bar</tt>) has one extra component on the front of it
        # (<tt>Views::</tt>) when compared to the subpath (<tt>foo/bar.rb</tt>) underneath what's on the autoload
        # path (<tt>app/views</tt>).

        # Go compute our view roots.
        #
        # Rails 3.0.x doesn't define #expanded on ::Rails::Paths::Path; it also has a different way of getting at
        # the view paths (<tt>::Rails.application.paths.app.views</tt>, rather than
        # <tt>::Rails.application.paths['app/views']</tt>). So, if we're on Rails 3.0.x, we simply inline the

        #
        # 1: We also need to patch ::Rails::Engine.eager_load! so that it loads classes under all view roots. However, we
        # can't just add them to the normal eager load paths, because that will allow people to do "require 'foo/bar'"
        # and have it match app/views/foo/bar.rb, which we don't want. So, instead, we load these classes ourselves.
        # Note that we ALSO have to do things slightly differently than Rails does it, because we need to skip loading
        # 'foo.rb' if 'foo.html.rb' exists -- and because we have to require the fully-qualified pathname, since
        # app/views is not actually on the load path.
        #
        # 2: I (ageweke) added this very late in the path of Fortitude development, after trying to use Fortitude in a
        # deployment (production) environment in which widgets just weren't getting loaded at all. Yet there's something
        # I don't understand: clearly, without this code, widgets will not be eager-loaded (which is probably not a
        # great thing for performance reasons)...but I think they still should get auto-loaded and hence actually work
        # just fine. But they don't in that environment (you'll get errors like "uninitialized constant Views::Base").
        # Since I understand what's going on and have the fix for it here, that's fine...except that I can't seem to
        # write a spec for it, because I don't know how to actually *make* it fail. If anybody comes along later and
        # knows what would make it fail (and I double-checked, and we don't have autoloading disabled in production or
        # anything like that), let me know, so that I can write a spec for this. Thanks!
